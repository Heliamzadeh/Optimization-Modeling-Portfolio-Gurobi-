Late submissions are NOT accepted. Also, files not in the correct format (other than a Jupyter Notebook) are NOT accepted.\n",
        "2. You can submit your answer file multiple times, but only the last submission is kept and graded.\n",
        "3. For each question, make sure to print all the results that the question asks. Also, prevent printing unnecessary information.\n",
        "4. We only grade the final answer, not the code, for coding questions. However, as the coding part of Question 7 can be a bit challenging, we will give **partial credit** for **concise and correct** explanations provided instead of the code only for this question. (Simple criterion: Your explanations should shed light on things that are not obvious from the question itself!)\n",

        "\n",
        "## The Story:\n",
        "The problem of allocating parliamentary seats in a *fair* way is a political matter in democratic societies. Suppose a country with a total population of $N = \\sum_i p_i$ tries to allocate its $s$ available seats to its provinces, each with a population of $p_i$. The *common sense* says that the *fair* way to distribute these seats is to allocate each province a seat quota proportional to its population:\n",
        "$$q_i = s \\times \\frac{p_i}{\\sum_i p_i}.$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Although this solution seems appealing, it ignores that the number of allocated seats must be **integers**. For instance, in a country with 30 million population and 130 parliament seats, the seat quota for a province with a population of 5 million is $q_i = \\frac{5 \\times 130}{30} = 21.\\overline{66}$, which is impossible. In this problem, we will use two methods that you are familiar with to address this issue - plus some additional considerations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Data:\n",
        "The country we are working on has 20 provinces, and its parliament has 601 seats. In the attached file *assignment2_data.csv*, you can find the dataset for this problem. The first column is the province's name, the second column is the province's population, and the third column is the quota ($q_i$) for the province. The quota for each province is the continuous value we calculated using the formula above as $q_i = s \\times \\frac{p_i}{\\sum_i p_i}$. Read the dataset using Python's Pandas package - or any package you choose - and extract the relevant information. (To ensure everyone is working with the same data, do not calculate the quotas again yourself; just use the given $q_i$ s.) For example, in this dataset, the population of province $P4$ is 3200000, and the quota for this province is 13.16359."

        "**Diminishing return to scale**: We expect the marginal profit of each additional unit from each store to decrease. That is, while a single pharmacy in the mall brings about \\$500,000 annual profit, having two pharmacies in the mall creates \\$800,000, and three pharmacies make \\$900,000 together. Therefore, the marginal profit of adding a new pharmacy is \\$500,000 when there is no pharmacy, \\$300,000 when there is one pharmacy, and \\$100,000 when there are already two pharmacies in the mall.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considering this phenomenon, our expectation for the annual profit created by the different number of restaurants, technology stores, and pharmacies is updated as in the following table: (Do not forget that the numbers in the following table represent the profit we expect all the stores to create together, not the profit produced by each of them. So, for example, we expect three restaurants to make \\$750,000 altogether.)\n",

        "The maximum number limit for each type of store/facility remains the same as the limits depicted in the original table, and the expected profit for stores/facilities other than restaurants, technology stores, and pharmacies is estimated linearly similar to the previous questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, suppose we decided to have 2 restaurants, 2 clothing stores, 1 tech store, 3 pharmacies, 3 toy stores, 1 toilet, and 2 security divisions in the mall. Then, the expected profit of this decision is:\n",

The issue is not resolved yet, and $S_8$ is still shut down. BalancedMilk managers are so excited that now you know how to implement logical constraints using MIP, because they want you to help them with their new problem! They gave you the following information:\n",
        "1. BalancedMilk is **not** committed to distributing the milk supplied by the remaining supply centers, $S_1$ to $S_7$. (It has the option not to distribute the milk it receives from the remaining supply centers.) Additionally, it **must not** oversupply any demand market.\n",
        "2. The cost of not supplying (not delivering) milk to each demand market is 15$/tonne.\n",
        "3. $S_3$, $S_4$, and $S_5$ belong to the same company. The company has imposed the following constraint: BalancedMilk should utilize $\\geq50\\%$ (equal or more than $50\\%$) of the capacity of at least two of the three supply centers owned by this company.\n",
        "4. Because $D_5$ and $D_6$ are close, the firm has some flexibility in answering their demands. So either $D_5$ receives $\\geq80\\%$ of its demand, or $D_6$ receives $\\geq60\\%$ of its demand, or both.\n",
        "5. A competitor is trying to damage BalancedMilk's reputation by focusing on the discrimination it imposes between different demand centers. This competitor is trying to exploit the difference between $D_2$ and $D_8$ and $D_9$. Therefore, to respond to this criticism, if $D_2$ receives $> 50\\%$ of its demand, then $D_8$ and $D_9$ should both receive $\\geq50\\%$ of their demand as well.\n",
